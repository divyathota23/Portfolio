It's like getting report cards from a ton of people who watched the movies. Over 1,000 reviews for most films – that's a lot of opinions!\n",

    "Now, your mission is to be the Netflix Sherlock. Find out what kinds of movies people love the most, spot those directors who are like movie magicians, and see if there's a link between how good a movie is and when it came out. Are there trends changing over time? Any surprises lurking in the data?\n",
